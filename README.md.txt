# Associate Software Engineer Coding Assignment

This repository contains my solutions for the coding assignment for the Associate Software Engineer position at CloudVandana. 

## Java Assignments

### Assignment 1: Shuffle an Array

I have created an array with values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) and shuffled it.

### Assignment 2: Roman to Integer Conversion

I have implemented a Java program that converts a Roman numeral to an integer. For example, "IX" is converted to 9.

### Assignment 3: Pangram Checker

I've created a Java program that checks whether the input is a pangram, which is a sentence containing all the alphabets from A to Z.

## JavaScript Assignments

### Assignment 1: Reverse Words in a Sentence

I have developed a JavaScript function that takes a sentence as input and reverses every word in that sentence. For example, "This is a sunny day" becomes "shiT si a ynnus yad."

### Assignment 2: Sorting an Array in Descending Order

I've implemented a JavaScript function to sort an array in descending order.

## HTML Assignments

### Assignment 1: Basic Calculator

I have created a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the functionality to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It is designed as per the provided reference image.

### Assignment 2: Survey Form

I've built an HTML form with fields including First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Country (dropdown), Gender (checkbox), Profession, email, and mobile number. All input fields are required for form submission.
The form also has buttons for submitting and resetting the form, and it performs necessary validations. A popup displays selected values with labels. Closing the popup resets the form.
